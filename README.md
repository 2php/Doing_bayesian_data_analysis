============================

Python version of the programs described in the book [Doing bayesian data analysis](http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com.ar) by John K. Kruschke (AKA *the puppy book*).
The name of the programs are the same used in the book, except they begin with a number indicating the chapter. All programs are written in Python and instead of BUGS/JAGS PyMC3 library is used.
